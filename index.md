I am a security researcher and engineer at [Informal Systems][informal].

Informal Systems is a blockchain research company and a core contributor to the [Cosmos Network][cosmos-network] - _The Internet of Blockchains_.

Currently, I take care of quality and correctness assurance concerns of [ibc-rs][ibc-rs] (Rust implementation of the [Inter-Blockchain Communication][ibc] protocol) team.
In the past, I was part of [model-based-testing][mbt-informal] and software auditing team at Informal.

Before Informal, I was a computer science PhD student at [Université de Paris][u-paris] (currently, [Unversité Paris Cité][nouveau-nom]).
I worked in [Modeling and verification][2] team in [IRIF][3], a research laboratory of the same university and [CNRS][5].
My thesis was supervised by [Prof. Constantin Enea][1]. I successfully [defended my PhD thesis on March 30, 2021][7].

I specialize in automated testing of distributed systems.
My PhD work was mainly focused on different isolation levels of distributed databases.
I published [3 papers](/publications) about efficient testing of distributed transactional databases like Galera, CockroachDB and datastorages like AntidoteDB.

My B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science and M.Sc. in Computer Science were from [Chennai Mathematical Institute][4].
