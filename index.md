I am a computer science PhD student at Universite de Paris. I work in [Modeling and verification][2] team in [IRIF][3], a research laboratory of the same university and [CNRS][5]. My thesis is supervised by [Prof. Constantin Enea][1].

I specialize in automated verification of distributed system. My work is mainly focused on different isolation levels of distributed databases. I published [2 papers](/publications/) about verification of distributed transactional databases like Galera, CockroachDB and datastorages like AntidoteDB.
